## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Processing timer driven by turn start anchor
The frontend SHALL compute elapsed processing time from the `turnStartRef` anchor, set by `handleSend` and the `loader { state: "show" }` event, not from the `processing` state flag. The timer SHALL update every animation frame while the anchor is non-zero and reset to 0 when the turn ends.
The frontend SHALL compute elapsed processing time from the `turnStartRef` anchor set by the `assistant_start` event, not from the `processing` state flag. The timer SHALL update every animation frame while the turn is active (turnStartRef > 0) and reset to 0 when the turn ends.

#### Scenario: Timer starts on user submit
- **WHEN** the user sends a message (via Send button or Enter key)
- **THEN** `turnStartRef.current` is set to `Date.now()` in `handleSend` and the elapsed timer begins incrementing from 0s
- **WHEN** the server sends `assistant_start` event
- **THEN** `turnStartRef.current` is set to `Date.now()` and the elapsed timer begins incrementing from 0s

#### Scenario: Timer increments during thinking
- **WHEN** the model sends `thinking_delta` events and `turnStartRef.current > 0`
- **THEN** the `ThinkingBlock` summary displays `Thinking... (Xs)` where X increments approximately every second

#### Scenario: Timer increments during waiting
- **WHEN** `processing` is true but no streaming message has arrived yet (hasStreaming is false)
- **THEN** the `WaitingBubble` displays the elapsed time from `turnStartRef`, incrementing approximately every second

#### Scenario: Timer stops on agent end
- **WHEN** the server sends `loader` event with `state: "hide"` (from `agent_end`)
- **THEN** `turnStartRef.current` is set to 0 and the elapsed timer stops

#### Scenario: Timer starts on vision/OCR pre-processing
- **WHEN** the server sends `loader` event with `state: "show"` and `turnStartRef.current` is 0
- **THEN** `turnStartRef.current` is set to `Date.now()` and the elapsed timer begins incrementing
- **WHEN** the server sends `loader` event with `state: "hide"` (from `agent_end`)
- **THEN** `turnStartRef.current` is set to 0 and the elapsed timer stops

#### Scenario: Timer resets on error
- **WHEN** the server sends an `error` event
- **THEN** `turnStartRef.current` is set to 0 and the elapsed timer is reset

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Conversation view
The frontend SHALL display a scrollable conversation area showing user messages, assistant responses with streaming text, thinking blocks with elapsed time indicators, and tool call results, all using the warm flat design system styling. Message state management SHALL use the shared `conversationReducer` from `@dscode/shared/reducer` instead of inline event handling logic. The elapsed time display SHALL be derived from `turnStartRef` (set by `handleSend` or `loader { state: "show" }`) rather than the `processing` state flag.

#### Scenario: User message display
- **WHEN** user submits a message
- **THEN** the message appears right-aligned with a warm amber accent background and warm white text, using `border-radius: 12px` bubble shape with subtle fade-up entrance animation (disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`)

#### Scenario: Streaming assistant response
- **WHEN** the server sends `text_delta` events
- **THEN** the assistant message bubble updates incrementally via `conversationReducer`, using the warm surface background, `1px solid` border, and warm text colors

#### Scenario: Thinking block display with timer
- **WHEN** the server sends `thinking_delta` events
- **THEN** the thinking content appears in a collapsible `<details>` block (open during streaming) with muted warm styling and a subtle left border accent, and the summary shows `Thinking... (Xs)` where X is the elapsed seconds since `turnStartRef` was set by `handleSend`
- **WHEN** the server sends `thinking_delta` events
- **THEN** the thinking content appears in a collapsible `<details>` block (open during streaming) with muted warm styling and a subtle left border accent, and the summary shows `Thinking... (Xs)` where X is the elapsed seconds since `turnStartRef` was set by `assistant_start`

#### Scenario: Tool call display
- **WHEN** the server sends `tool_start` and `tool_end` events
- **THEN** each tool call appears as an inline flat card with `border-radius: 8px`, `1px solid` warm border, tool name in monospace with amber accent, and muted pastel success/error indicators

### Requirement: Input area
### Requirement: Input area
The frontend SHALL provide a text input area at the bottom of the screen with flat, rounded styling using the warm design system. The send button SHALL switch to a Stop button while the agent is processing (when `processing` is true, controlled exclusively by `handleSend` and the `loader` event from `agent_end`). The `assistant_end` event SHALL NOT affect the `processing` state — it only finalizes the streaming message.

#### Scenario: Text input and submit
- **WHEN** user types text and presses Enter (or clicks send button)
- **THEN** a `chat` command is sent via WebSocket with the input text, and `processing` is set to `true` immediately

#### Scenario: Input styling
- **WHEN** the input field is rendered
- **THEN** it has `border-radius: 12px`, `border: 1px solid var(--color-border)`, warm surface background, proportional font (Geist Sans), and a subtle accent border color on focus — no glow, no shadow, no pill shape

#### Scenario: Slash command autocomplete
- **WHEN** user types `/` in the input field
- **THEN** a flat dropdown appears with `border-radius: 8px`, `1px solid` border, listing available commands with warm-toned styling and amber highlight for selected item

#### Scenario: At-file autocomplete
- **WHEN** user types `@` in the input field
- **THEN** a flat dropdown appears with matching warm styling

#### Scenario: Multi-line input
- **WHEN** user presses Shift+Enter in the input field
- **THEN** a new line is inserted without submitting

#### Scenario: Input disabled during processing
- **WHEN** the agent is processing a request (`processing` is true)
- **THEN** the input field is disabled with a muted appearance

#### Scenario: Send button becomes Stop button during processing
- **WHEN** `processing` becomes true (via `handleSend`)
- **THEN** the send button is replaced by a Stop button that calls `onAbort` when clicked

#### Scenario: Stop button reverts to Send when processing ends
- **WHEN** the `loader` event with `state: "hide"` is received from the server
- **THEN** `processing` is set to `false` and the Stop button reverts to the Send button
